Changes in import part in projects:

2 withServerTransition is now deprecated. APP_ID can be set.
3 Remove any reference to @Directive/@Component moduleId property.
4 Update imports from import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@angular/platform-browser' to import {makeStateKey, StateKey, TransferState} from '@angular/core'.
5 entryComponents is no longer available and any reference to it can be removed from the @NgModule and @Component public APIs.
6 ngTemplateOutletContext has stricter type checking which requires you to declare all the properties in the corresponding object.
7 Angular packages no longer include FESM2015 and the distributed ECMScript has been updated from 2020 to 2022.
8 BrowserTransferStateModule is no longer available and any reference to it can be removed from your applications.
9 Update your code to use Injector.create rather than ReflectiveInjector since ReflectiveInjector is removed.
10 QueryList.filter now supports type guard functions. Since the type will be narrowed, you may have to update your application code that relies on the old behavior.
